            <article class="dw_article">
                <p>SAN DIEGO — When Jodie Whit&shy;tak&shy;er got the news some
                    months ago that she had been cast as the pro&shy;tag&shy;o&shy;nist
                    of “Doc&shy;tor Who,” the long-run&shy;ning BBC se&shy;ries,
                     she went through a range of over&shy;whelmed
                    re&shy;ac&shy;tions. She cried; she caught her breath;
                     she ex&shy;cit&shy;ed&shy;ly squeezed the knee
                    of a col&shy;league sit&shy;ting next to her. To be
                    told that she would in&shy;her&shy;it the role of
                    the Doc&shy;tor, a time-trav&shy;el&shy;ing, space-far&shy;ing
                    ad&shy;ven&shy;tur&shy;er who is per&shy;haps
                    one of the most rec&shy;og&shy;niz&shy;able heroes in sci&shy;ence
                    fic&shy;tion, Ms. Whit&shy;tak&shy;er
                    said, wasn’t part of my mind-set as an ac&shy;tress,
                    that it was pos&shy;si&shy;ble.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Ms. Whit&shy;ta&shy;ker, 36, who un&shy;til now was
                    best known for her work on the Brit&shy;ish crime dra&shy;ma “Broadchurch,”
                    the cast&shy;ing de&shy;ci&shy;sion was life&shy;al&shy;
                    ter&shy;ing, as it would be for an&shy;y per&shy;form&shy;er
                    — a guar&shy;an&shy;tee that, when it was an&shy;nounced
                    to the pub&shy;lic.

                    Re&shy;cent sales may have been purring, but Soft&shy;cat
                     struck an un&shy;ex&shy;pect&shy;ed&shy;ly cau&shy;tious note about
                    its prospects for the com&shy;ing year yes&shy;ter&shy;day,
                     prompt&shy;ing an 11.5 cent fall in its share
                    price. The com&shy;pa&shy;ny, one of Britain’s biggest
                    com&shy;put&shy;er and soft&shy;ware re&shy;sellers,
                    said that rev&shy;enue growth would slow from its
                     pre&shy;sent strong lev&shy;els, with un&shy;cer&shy;tain&shy;ties
                    around Brex&shy;it po&shy;ten&shy;tial&shy;ly putting
                    the brakes on busi&shy;ness con&shy;fi&shy;dence.

                    The city of Ed&shy;in&shy;burgh has opened a pub&shy;lic
                    con&shy;sul&shy;ta&shy;tion in&shy;to a pro&shy;posed tourist tax.
                    The city coun&shy;cil’s con&shy;sul&shy;ta&shy;tion will
                    run un&shy;til De&shy;cem&shy;ber 10 and seeks
